## Game Description
The Archer click game UI is built in React. Upon page load, the user can click on any image (in this case, characters from the FXX Show Archer). The user must then click on a different picture until they reach max score (12). If any picture is clicked twice before all other pictures have clicked, the game restarts.

Frameworks:

React
HTML5 Audio
Semantic UI for React
