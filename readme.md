## Archer Click Game: Game Description
The Archer Click Game UI is built in React. Upon page load, the user can click on any image (in this case, characters from the FXX show Archer). The user must then click on a different character until they reach max score (12). If any character is clicked twice before all other characters are clicked, the game ends and the counter restarts.

### Frameworks:

<li>React</li>
<li>HTML5 Audio</li>
<li>Semantic UI for React</li>
